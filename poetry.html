				<h5>Love's Undeniable Bloom</h5>
				<h6>By Medrino Win L. Cruz <br> 'Until I Found You'</h6>
				<p>In heaven's grasp, we met, old friends turned new,
					<br> Yet questions lingered, casting shadows drear,
					<br> Could friendship thrive, or love disrupt the view?
					<br> A choice to make, a future drawing near.
					<br>
					<br> I'd face the grave before love's flame would wane,
					<br> As Juliet to her steadfast Romeo.
					<br> To die a noble death, love's sweetest pain,
					<br> Than watch our love in friendship's shadow throw.
					<br>
					<br> Lost in shadows deep, Romeo heard my plea,
					<br> A solemn oath that echoed through the night,
					<br> "I'd never fall unless it's you," said he,
					<br> Guided by love's unwavering light.
					<br>
					<br> "I finally found you," whispered fate's decree so grand,
					<br> In love's embrace, I've found my promised land. </p>

				<h5>License to Dream</h5>
				<h6>By Ayzhel Charm P. Gamboa <br> 'Driver's License'</h6>
				<p>In whispered sobs, heartache's silent moan
					<br> I tread these streets, my heart a weighty load
					<br> A license in my hand, but not to own
					<br> Our love was once a path with tales untold
					<br>
					<br> The signs that marked our love began to wane
					<br> A love-struck road now lost in shadows' haze
					<br> Though I clung on, your absence cast a bane
					<br> And led me through a labyrinth of love's malaise
					<br>
					<br> With every turn, I sought to trace my way
					<br> Through memories of you that steadfast persist
					<br> But now, my love, you've left, and there you'll stay
					<br> In echoes of a love that can't resist
					<br>
					<br> My driver's license narrates a tale of woe
					<br> Of love's early signs, signaling to let go
					<br>

				<h5>Atlantis of the Heart</h5>
				<h6>By Anekein Caldae H. Garcia <br> 'Atlantis'</h6>
				<p>A coral castle, carved by love's warm tide,
					<br>Now stands in ruin, washed by sorrow's wave.
					<br>Our promises, on seagull wings they ride,
					<br>Lost whispers clinging to the ocean's grave.
					<br>
					<br>The gentle tides that kissed our love, now still,
					<br>In wistful depths, our fates diverged, apart,
					<br>Where whispered dreams, in silence, haunt and fill,
					<br>The void that shrouds what once embraced the heart.
					<br>
					<br>Our love, a whispered sigh on parchment old,
					<br>Sank beneath the waves, where Atlantis sleeps.
					<br>A fleeting flame on souls now cracked and cold,
					<br>A relic of what was, a phantom that weeps.
					<br>
					<br>Though submerged deep, our memories hold fast,
					<br>Lost love, a treasure of the sunken past. </p>

				<h5>Enchanted: Echoes of Love</h5>
				<h6>By Medrino Win L. Cruz <br> 'Enchanted'</h6>
				<p>In enchanted realms where melodies play
					<br> This is me praying that, on the first page
					<br> Not where the storyline ends, in love's cage
					<br> My thoughts will echo your name, night and day
					<br>
					<br> Until we meet again, heartfelt prayers light my way
					<br> These are the words I held back, in youth's stage
					<br> As I was leaving too soon, time's cruel gauge
					<br> In life's ballet, enchanted, our hearts in sway
					<br>
					<br> Resist the spell of one's beguiling charm
					<br> Nurture your dreams as others' hugs enhance
					<br> A plea to fate echoes in this heartfelt psalm
					<br> Don't let one linger, heart caught in a fervent dance
					<br> Shun narratives that try to inform
					<br> In love's song, let our duet gracefully entrance </p>

				<h5>The Push and Pull, Drowning in Your Flame</h5>
				<h6>By Ayzhel Charm P. Gamboa <br> 'Love the Way You Lie'</h6>
				<p>In love's beguiling play, you witness my yearn
					<br> As passion's flames devour both hearts and minds
					<br> Amidst the chaos, love's design entwined
					<br> Yet strangely, I'm enthralled, the lessons discerned
					<br>
					<br> Embracing lies, in this pain, we're adjourned
					<br> In this dance, the truth's captivity finds
					<br> The way we hurt, our destinies aligned
					<br> Captivated by the lies I've earned
					<br>
					<br> Love's sweet enchantment starts in the beginning
					<br> With fiery sparks igniting souls aflame
					<br> Yet, early cracks appear, like art, thinning
					<br>
					<br> Revealing truth, a sadistic game's claim
					<br> In the end, we're drowning, torn and pining
					<br> Love's contradiction, adoring your name
					<br>

				<h5>Tears for a Memory</h5>
				<h6>By Anekein Caldae H. Garcia <br> 'Another Love'</h6>
				<p>In twilight's cold, where frosty winds declare
					<br>My love, in blooms that once adorned the spring 
					<br>A string of daffodils, no warmth they bring 
					<br>Just echoes of a time when all was fair
					<br>
					<br>Desire to soothe, to chase away despair 
					<br>But nights, they haunt, where loneliness takes wing 
					<br>For tears spent on a love that ceased to sing 
					<br>Now, love's refrain lost in the wintry air 
					<br>
					<br>With fractured hand, the wish to shield from harm 
					<br>My voice, a weapon, though dulled by winter's sting 
					<br>A verse, a tender ballad, aching true 
					<br>But sung to someone else, another's charm 
					<br>A yearning note, in silence, takes its wing 
					<br>My tears, they're spent, on love I once knew 
					<br> </p>
