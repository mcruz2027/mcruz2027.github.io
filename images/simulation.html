				<h1>Understanding the Digestive System Through Simulation</h1>
				<br>
				<p>In order to increase our knowledge of the digestive system, the objective of this laboratory page is to simulate crucial digestive processes and investigate the stages of food processing. It is essential to comprehend these processes in order to fully comprehend how the body digests and consumes nutrients. </p>
				<h3>Section 1: Stages of Food Processing</h3>
				<h4>Subsection: Crushing Stage</h4>
				<p><i>Q1: The zip-lock bag simulates the stomach's environment. </i>
					<br> Observation: The zip-lock bag effectively simulated the stomach in our testing scenario. The flexibility of the bag enabled a dynamic replication of the stomach's conditions, imitating the early phase of food digestion.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q2: The addition of water mimics the role of gastric juices. </i>
					<br> Observation: The intentional addition of water to the zip-lock bag was made in order to simulate the function of gastric juices in the stomach. The introduction of this liquid facilitated the beginning of the chemical breakdown of food, thus establishing a more authentic setting for our experimental model.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q3: The zip-locked bag represents the stomach.</i>
					<br> Objective: Our main goal was to accurately reproduce the complex mechanical and chemical processes involved in the digesting function of the stomach. In order to do this, we effectively utilized a zip-lock bag as a substitute for this crucial digestive organ. The bag's unique flexibility was crucial in conducting a dynamic simulation that accurately replicated the complex nature of stomach function. This allowed for both the mechanical breakdown of food particles and the introduction of gastric-like fluids. In addition, our experimental design included an extra level of anatomical representation inside the zip-lock bag. We conceived the zip-lock bag to symbolize the lower esophageal sphincter, in addition to its function as a representation of the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter acts as a regulatory mechanism, controlling the flow of chemicals between the esophagus and the stomach to avoid unwanted reflux. Our simulation acquired depth by recognizing the zip-lock bag's dual function as both a stomach surrogate and a model of the lower esophageal sphincter. The inclusion of this additional anatomical picture offers a detailed viewpoint, highlighting the complex physiological aspects of the digestive process and underscoring the importance of anatomical components in preserving the functionality of the digestive system.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q4: The act of crushing the food imitates the mechanical process of breaking it down in the stomach.</i>
					<br> Discussion: The process of crushing the food within the zip-lock bag was a crucial stage in replicating the mechanical breakdown that takes place in the stomach during digestion. This simulation enabled the observation of the process by which large food particles were fragmented into smaller, more easily handled fragments, resembling the earliest phase of digestion inside the stomach.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q5: The use of orange juice imitates the acidic digestion processes.</i>
					<br> Discussion: The decision to include orange juice inside the zip-lock bag was made in order to simulate the acidic environment often present in the stomach. By replicating the conditions of the stomach, this addition enhanced chemical digestion by creating an acidic environment, which resulted in the breakdown of biomolecule components such as carbs in crackers and sugars in bananas.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q6: Potential components of biomolecules include carbs found in crackers and sugars present in bananas.</i> Discussion: We recognized the existence of several biomolecule components due to the varying character of the food products utilized. The crackers provided carbs, while the bananas introduced sugars, enabling us to study the digestive processes of these separate components in our simulated stomach environment. </p>
				<h4>Subsection: Transfer Stage</h4>
				<p> <i>Q7: The liquid that comes out of the stocking imitates the nutrient-rich liquid that exits the stomach.</i>
					<br> Observation: During the transfer step, the liquid that came out of the stocking symbolized the nutrient-rich liquid exiting the stomach. The purpose of this phase was to simulate the transfer of partly digested substances from the stomach to the small intestine.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q8: The tray symbolizes the tiny intestine.</i>
					<br> Observation: In our experimental model, we identified and assigned the tray as the small intestine. This decision enabled us to concentrate on the incorporation and eventual breakdown of nutrients as they crossed the digestive tract.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q9: The residue remaining in the stocking imitates stuff that has not been digested or absorbed.</i>
					<br> Observation: The leftover substance found in the stocking after the transfer phase acted as a visible indication of stuff that had not been digested or absorbed. This factor was essential in evaluating the efficacy of the simulated digestive process.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q10: Exerting force on a partly hardened substance imitates the constant contraction and relaxation of muscles in the digestive system, known as peristalsis.</i>
					<br> Discussion: The process of exerting force on partly hardened material via the stocking was intended to imitate peristalsis, the coordinated contraction and relaxation of muscles in the digestive tract. This phase highlighted the significance of muscle contractions in pushing substances through the digestive system. </p>
				<h3>Section 2: Simulation of Absorption</h3>
				<p> <i>Q11: Which paper towel absorbed the largest amount of water? What could be the possible explanation?</i>
					<br> Observed: The paper towel that exhibited the greatest water absorption was the one with the fewest folds. The paper towel that was folded once (99 ml) showed the most water absorption in this scenario.
					<br>
					<br> Explanation: Reducing the number of folds increases the available surface area of the paper towel that may come into contact with the water. When the paper towel is folded, the available surface area for absorption reduces. Hence, the paper towel with a lesser number of folds has a larger amount of exposed surface area, hence enabling enhanced water absorption. The findings indicate that the initial surface area of the paper towel significantly influences its ability to absorb liquids.
					<br>
					<br> <i>Q12: In which organ of the digestive system can you compare the paper towels? How does the structure of the organ help in its function?</i>
					<br>
					<br> Comparative organ: The small intestine is an appropriate organ inside the digestive system for the purpose of comparing the paper towels.
					<br>
					<br> Analysis of the structure and operation: The small intestine has distinctive structural attributes, including folds, villi, and microvilli, that greatly enhance its surface area. The increased surface area is crucial for the assimilation of nutrients from ingested food. Similarly, when comparing paper towels, the creases may be compared to the creases of the small intestine, and the water absorption can be correlated with the absorption of nutrients in the digestive process. The shape of the small intestine enhances its functionality by optimizing the surface area of contact between the contents of digestion and the surfaces responsible for absorption. Similarly, in the digestive tract, the effectiveness of nutrient absorption is directly linked to the amount of surface area that is accessible for absorption. So, comparing paper towels to the small intestine shows how important surface area is in both situations: the process of absorption in the paper towel experiment and the process of nutrient absorption in the small intestine. </p>
				<h3>Section 3: Simulation of Bile Action</h3>
				<p> <i>Q13: Bile has the function of emulsifying lipids and assisting in chemical digestion.</i>
					<br> Discussion: During our investigation into the function of bile, we acknowledged its importance in the process of emulsifying lipids that occurs during digestion. This stage focused on the chemical processes that occur when complex fats are broken down into smaller, more easily digested components. This is important for the effective absorption of nutrients.
					<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
					<p>This simulation provides valuable insights into the complex workings of the digestive system. Real-world applications comprise the development of interventions for digestive disorders and the comprehension of how diet influences digestion. In general, this practical experience enhances our comprehension of the complex mechanisms operating within the digestive system. </p>
